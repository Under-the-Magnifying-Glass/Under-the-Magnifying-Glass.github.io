        <h3><a name="primo">CHAPTER I</a> </h3>
<p>
     To <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>  she is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard him
     mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
     predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any
     emotion akin to love for <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Irene Adler</span>. All emotions, and that one
     particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
     balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
     observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would
     have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer
     passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things
     for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives
     and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions
     into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to
     introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his
     mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of
     his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong
     emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to
     him, and that woman was the late Irene <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler,</span> of dubious and
     questionable memory.</p><p>     I had seen little of <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> lately. My marriage had drifted us away
     from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
     interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
     of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
     while <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, who loathed every form of society with his whole
     Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>, buried among
     his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and
     ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his
     own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study
     of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers
     of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
     mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official
     police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:
     of his summons to <span class="places" about="Odessa">Odessa</span> in the case of <span class="citedCase" about="TrepoffMurder">the Trepoff murder</span>, of his
     clearing up of the singular <span class="citedCase" about="Atkinson">tragedy of the Atkinson brothers</span> at <span class="places" about="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</span>
     , and finally of the <span class="citedCase" about="ReigningFamily">mission</span> which he had accomplished so
     delicately and successfully for the reigning family of <span class="places" about="Holland">Holland</span>.
     Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared
     with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former
     friend and companion. </p><p>     One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning
     from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
     practice), when my way led me through <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>. As I passed the
     well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with
     my wooing, and with the dark incidents of <span class="works" about="StudyScarlet">the Study in Scarlet</span>, I was
     seized with a keen desire to see <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> again, and to know how he was
     employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,
     and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in
     a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
     eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped
     behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude
     and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen
     out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
     problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had
     formerly been in part my own.</p><p>
     His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
     to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
     me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
     spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the
     fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</p>

     </figure>
     <p>     "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>, that you have put
     on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."</p><p>     "Seven!" I answered.</p><p>     "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
     fancy, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span> . And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
     that you intended to go into harness."</p><p>     "Then, how do you know?"</p><p>     "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
     yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
     careless servant girl?"</p><p>   "My dear <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> ," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have
     been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had
     a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
     have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to <span class="character" about="MaryJane">Mary Jane</span>
    , she is incorrigible, and <span class="fcharacter" about="MrsWatson">my wife</span> has given her notice, but
     there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
