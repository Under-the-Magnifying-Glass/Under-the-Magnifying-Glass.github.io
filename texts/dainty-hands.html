<h3>MODERNITY AND STEREOTYPE IN THE <span class="character" about="Sherlock">SHERLOCK HOLMES</span> CANON</h3>

<p>The <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> stories, <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s most beloved and popular
works, were serially published in <cite>Strand Magazine</cite> and in other venues
throughout the late nineteenth century.<sup><a href="#f53">53</a></sup> <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> provided <cite>Strand</cite> readers-
arguably a broader and less exclusive audience than that of more
<q>highbrow</q> literary work<sup><a href="#f54">54</a></sup> -with fifty-six short stories and four novels,
published between 1891 and 1927.<sup><a href="#f55">55</a></sup></p>

<p>The <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> stories are characterized by an interesting mix of
Gothic fiction elements and an unwavering commitment to the nascent
forensic scientific method.<sup><a href="#f56">56</a></sup> The late nineteenth century saw the birth of
positivist criminology-a family of criminological theories that ascribed an
individual's criminal behavior to their innate pathological qualities.<sup><a href="#f57">57</a></sup> This
new view of criminality challenged the Enlightenment-era philosophical
notions of thinkers such as <span class="people" about="Beccaria">Cesare Beccaria</span><sup><a href="#f58">58</a></sup> and <span class="people" about="Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</span>,<sup><a href="#f59">59</a></sup> who
saw crime as the outcome of cost-benefit analysis by free, rational agents,
whose decision-making process could be changed by using punishment as a
legal disincentive. In contrast, the heralds of the new positivist approach
were continental scientists such as <span class="people" about="Lombroso">Cesare Lombroso</span> and <span class="people" about="Ferri">Enrico Ferri</span>,
whose object of inquiry was not crime itself, but rather the criminal.<sup><a href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>

<p><span class="people" about="Lombroso">Lombroso</span>'s book, <cite>L'Uomo Delinquente</cite> (<q>Criminal Man</q>),<sup><a href="#f61">61</a></sup> argues that
criminals are characterized by atavism, a more primitive stage of evolution,
and finds evidence for their criminal propensity in physical traits, ranging
from cranial and bodily measurements<sup><a href="#f62">62</a></sup> to facial expressions and tattoos.<sup><a href="#f63">63</a></sup></p>

<p><span class="people" about="Lombroso">Lombroso</span>'s body of scientific work paid particular attention to ethnicity,
providing pages upon pages of illustrations of criminals of different
nationalities.<sup><a href="#f64">64</a></sup> Particularly pertinent to this Article is his book devoted to
female criminals, in which he argued that they were <q>doubly abnormal,</q>
due to their deviance from the norm in both their gender and their
criminality.<sup><a href="#f65">65</a></sup></p>

<p><span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s universe of detective fiction was decidedly influenced by the
positivist enterprise. Like some of his contemporaries, <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> portrayed
<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s method as relying exclusively on logical deduction and scientific
innovations.<sup><a href="#f66">66</a></sup> Probably modeled after <span class="people" about="Bell">Dr. Joseph Bell</span>, <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s mentor at
the <span class="places" about="Edimburgh">University of Edinburgh</span> medical school and an innovator of forensic
medicine,<sup><a href="#f67">67</a></sup>  <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> is described as scrupulously rational, calculating, and
sometimes machine-like and devoid of feeling.<sup><a href="#f68">68</a></sup>  <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> constantly relies
on crime scene findings, such as foot tracks and chemical analysis, to reach
conclusions, but much of his reasoning is based on generalizations about
human nature stemming from his observations of human behavior.<sup><a href="#f69">69</a></sup> </p>

<p>As with positivist criminologists, <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s concern is not with the
law, but with criminality as a phenomenon; the back story is at least as
important as the crime itself. In that respect, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s position as the
world's only <q>consulting detective</q> awards him a certain ambiguous
position with respect to official law enforcement. In many stories, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>
and <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span> collaborate with the police, but they also accept private clients.
Moreover, on several occasions, due to his innate sense of the just outcome
of the case, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> does not report criminals to the police. He seems more
focused on their story and etiology than on the technical elements of the
offense. The fluidity in the amount of sympathy <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> has for the
different characters in his cases makes categorization of these characters as
<q>victims</q> or <q>criminals</q> problematic. Nonetheless, the stories are
populated by a gallery of characters-clients, witnesses, perpetrators from
all social classes-and, among them, a surprising number of women.</p>

<h3>B. FEMALE CHARACTERS IN <span class="character" about="Sherlock">SHERLOCK HOLMES</span> STORIES</h3>

<p>Women in <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> stories represent a full spectrum of the
Victorian social universe (<a href="#tab1">See Table 1</a>). <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> casts women as victims and
perpetrators of crime with equal frequency, and includes women in the
roles of various neutral parties as well. With respect to social class, the
characters run the gamut from street women and outcasts to royalty. Some
characters in the later stories could be characterized as <q>new money,</q> due
to marrying industrialists; and a few characters are placed outside the
traditional social class ladder, especially those with artistic or bohemian
interests.</p>

<p>Ethnicity also varies among <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s cast of secondary characters and
plays an important part in the stereotypes applied to these women. Most of
<span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s female characters are British, but there is a considerable minority
of American and Australian women. There are also a few European and a
handful of Latin American characters in <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s later stories.</p>

<p>Women's roles as victims, neutral parties, or perpetrators in the stories
vary across social classes. Sensational violent crime is perpetuated by
women of noble stature (such as the anonymous murderess of blackmailer
<span class="character" about="Milverton">Charles Augustus Milverton</span>)<sup><a href="#f71">71</a></sup> as well as by ill-reputed street women (such
as <span class="character" about="Winter">Kitty Winter</span>, who threw vitriol in Baron Gruner's face to avenge his
corruption of her in <cite><span class="works" about="NBachelor">The Noble Bachelor</span></cite>).<sup><a href="#f72">72</a></sup> Women outside the social
order (bohemian/artistic) are more likely to be cast as entrepreneurial free
agents. The quintessential example <span class="character" about="IreneAdler">is Irene Adler</span>, discussed in depth
below,<sup><a href="#f73">73</a></sup> but there are others, such as <span class="character" about="Ronder">Mrs. Ronder</span> (a circus professional
involved in a sophisticated plot to murder her husband).<sup><a href="#f74">74</a></sup> In other cases,
wealth appears to be a double-edged sword. Most wealthy women (like the
victims of blackmailer <span class="character" about="Milverton">Charles Augustus Milverton</span>,<sup><a href="#f75">75</a></sup> the kidnapped <span class="fcharacter" about="Carfax">Lady
Frances Carfax</span><sup><a href="#f76">76</a></sup> and maltreated wives <span class="fcharacter" about="Barclay">Nancy Barclay</span><sup><a href="#f77">77</a></sup> and <span class="character" about="Brackenstall">Mary
Brackenstall</span><sup><a href="#f78">78</a></sup>) are cast as prisoners in gilded cages. A few others, like
<span class="character" about="Klein">Isadora Klein</span>,<sup><a href="#f79">79</a></sup> find wealth a source of power and strength (and often a
resource assisting them in committing crime). Women of certain social
classes, particularly single women, are portrayed as especially vulnerable to
victimization. Examples include governesses and women of independent
wealth traveling alone. In the former group are women placed under the
power of families in remote estates such as <span class="character" about="Hunter">Violet Hunter</span>,<sup><a href="#f80">80</a></sup> enlisted against
her will to participate in identity deceit, and <span class="character" about="Smith">Violet Smith</span>,<sup><a href="#f81">81</a></sup> whose
employer plans to marry her for money. An example of the latter group is
<span class="character" about="Carfax">Lady Frances Carfax</span>, who falls prey to dangerous swindlers.<sup><a href="#f82">82</a></sup></p>

<p>Ethnicity, too, plays an important part in explaining not only the role
but the etiology of the woman's criminality or her victimhood. European
women figure into the stories mostly as minor (and sometimes reluctant)
accomplices to male European criminal masterminds. For example, <span class="character" about="Sophia">Sophia</span>
in <cite><span class="works" about="GInterpreter">The Greek Interpreter</span></cite><sup><a href="#f83">83</a></sup> is under the power of rascals who kidnapped her
brother; <span class="character" about="Elsie">Elsie in <cite><span class="works" about="Engineer">The Engineer's Thumb</span></cite><sup><a href="#f84">84</a></sup> is under the power of a master
counterfeiter; and <span class="character" about="Schlessinger">Mrs. Schlessinger</span> in <cite>The Disappearance of Lady
Frances Carfax</cite><sup><a href="#f85">85</a></sup> helps her husband to kidnap and plan to bury alive the
eponymous <cite><span class="character" about="Carfax">Lady Frances.</p>

<p>Eight stories feature women from colonies in the <span class="places" about="Americas">Americas</span> or
    <span class="places" about="Australia">Australia</span>. South American women are often depicted as wild, disturbed,
and possibly insane. All eight women from the colonies were cast as
having had <q>grown up wild</q> in <span class="places" about="America">America</span> or <span class="places" about="Australia">Australia</span>, and all stories
involving them feature unsavory aspects of their past-former husbands or
suitors, for the most part-haunting them in the present. Some of these
past connections were tied to organized crime in the colonies (<span class="character" about="Cubitt">Elsie Cubitt</span>
from <cite><span class="works" about="DancingMen">The Dancing Men</span></cite><sup><a href="#f86">86</a></sup> is stalked and threatened in letters written in a
special code), while others are related to exotic occurrences (the death of
<span class="character" about="Munro">Effie Munro</span>'s African-American husband in a fire;<sup><a href="#f87">87</a></sup> the loss of <span class="character" about="StClair">Lady St.
Clair</span>'s former husband in the San Francisco mines<sup><a href="#f88">88</a></sup>). All colonial women
are explicitly described as wild, spirited, and passionate.</p>

<p><span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> devotes a considerable amount of energy to describing his
female characters. Following the introduction of a female client or witness,
the stories include a paragraph describing her appearance as well as the
character traits stemming from that appearance. In other cases, this
description is provided by one of the other protagonists in the story. Table
2 summarizes the qualities attributed to all female characters.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, <span class="people" about="Lacey">Lacey</span> posits that the shift in perceptions of
women's criminality from entrepreneurial to powerless was an ongoing
process throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An examination
of the qualities ascribed to the female characters in the <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> stories
bears out this hypothesis. The stories published in the late nineteenth
century feature mostly passive women, many of them overpowered by
men. The stories also feature women described as brave, clever, and
driven. It is notable, though, that descriptions of characters as smart, brave,
and resourceful, occur for the most part in the earlier stories (the
characters' intelligence is not noted until after 1892; bravery disappears
from categorizations in 1904; and five out of the six brave characters
appear before 1893), and that the only two insane or pathological
characters appear in the later stories (1904 and 1922). The most common
descriptor of these women is their physical beauty, which remains
consistent in texts across all years of publication.</p>

<h3>B. NARRATIVES OF WOMEN AND CRIME: CAPTIVES, PROTECTORS, MUSES,
    AND ENTREPRENEURS</h3>

<p>The <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> stories place women in a variety of situations
involving criminality and victimization. These situations can be placed
into four main schemas: Captives, Protectors, Muses, and Entrepreneurs, as
presented in Table 3. The first three categories are excellent examples of
Lacey's <q>Tess-like</q> women, whose fates are largely determined by
circumstance and a powerful patriarchal society. The fourth category,
however, describes <q>Moll-esque</q> characters with drive, initiative, and free
agency who were still present in the late nineteenth century. This is
consistent with Lacey's assessment that such characters were still
embraced, to some extent, into the late nineteenth century.</p>

<p>One of the most important findings about these characterizations is that
they apply to criminals and noncriminals alike. In each category there are
women who commit crime, women who witness crime, and women who
fall victim to crime. Granted, their actions under the circumstances are
praised or reviled according to <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s-<span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s-sense of justice,
which does not necessarily neatly map onto the likely legal disposition of
the case. However, the dichotomies of power and powerlessness, free
agency and predestination, protection and support, apply to the female
characters regardless of their position on the victim/criminal divide. The
women are primarily categorized by their position in society and
relationship with men in their lives. This suggests that femininity, rather
than criminality, is the organizing principle in crafting these characters.
Table 3 presents this categorization, including some subcategories.</p>

<h4>1. Captives</h4>

<p>Many examples of captives populate the Holmesian canon. These are
women trapped in situations over which they have no control. The classic
female <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> client is a <q>damsel in distress,</q> asking for his help and
protection in navigating oppressive circumstances. Some such clients, like
<cite><span class="works" about="SpeckledBand">The Speckled Band</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Stoner">Helen Stoner</span><sup><a href="#f89">89</a></sup> and <cite><span class="works" about="CaseIdentity">A Case of Identity</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Sutherland">Mary
Sutherland</span>,<sup><a href="#f90">90</a></sup> are at the mercy of ruthless male relatives. Some, like <cite><span class="works" about="SignsFour">The
Sign of the Four</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Morstan">Mary Morstan</span>,<sup><a href="#f91">91</a></sup> are thrown into messes created by such
relatives. Others, like <cite><span class="works" about="CopperBeeches">The Copper Beeches</span></cite>' <span class="character" about="Hunter">Violet Hunter</span><sup><a href="#f92">92</a></sup> and <cite><span class="works" about="SolitaryCyclist">The
Solitary Cyclist</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Smith">Violet Smith</span>,<sup><a href="#f93">93</a></sup> are exploited by evil employers. Some of
them, like the eponymous <span class="character" about="Carfax">Lady Frances Carfax</span>,<sup><a href="#f94">94</a></sup> are apprehended and
overpowered by villains when they exhibit independence that exceeds the
appropriate female social roles. It should be noted that these characters,
and others in the <q>captive</q> category, are often thrown into the path of peril
when they assert their independence in any meaningful way, such as
seeking employment, traveling, or planning to marry against parental
wishes or interests. <cite><span class="works" about="CopperBeeches">The Copper Beeches</span></cite> is particularly interesting in this
respect. <span class="character" about="Hunter">Violet Hunter</span>, an aspiring governess pondering on the prudence of
accepting a peculiar position, seeks <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s advice not only as a
professional consulting detective, but as a surrogate male relative:</p>
<blockquote>"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my
      companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange
      experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from
      whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind
      enough to tell me what I should do."<sup><a href="#f95">95</a></sup>
    <br><span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> responds in kind:<br>
    <quote>I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a
    sister of mine apply for.</quote><sup><a href="#f96">96</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>When later developments regarding Hunter's new employers confirm
    <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s and Hunter's concerns, he asks for her cooperation in assisting
his and <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>'s entry to the house in question:</p>

<blockquote>"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
    brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
    perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think
    you a quite exceptional woman."<sup><a href="#f97">97</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>And, lest we think that Hunter's qualities may be common among
women, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span> ends the story by explicitly informing us of her
idiosyncrasy and uniqueness through her later exploits:</p>

<blockquote>As to <span class="character" about="Hunter">Miss Violet Hunter</span>, my friend <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, rather to my
    disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once
    she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is
    now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I believe that
    she has met with considerable success.<sup><a href="#f98">98</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>It is important to mention, however, that not all captives are innocents.
An important subcategory of captives is that of women who find
themselves under the power of ruthless criminal men, be they lovers,
husbands or fathers. In many instances the woman falls prey to the man's
machinations; in others, she is made an accomplice to his crimes, which
makes her no less of a captive. Such accomplices are often, though not
always, portrayed with sympathy despite their involvement in committing
the crime.</p>

<p>A classic example of this subcategory is <cite><span class="works" about="Baskerville">The Hound of the
Baskervilles</span></cite>' <span class="character" about="Stapleton">Beryl Stapleton</span>, who, while sympathetic to her husband's
unsuspecting victim, can hardly escape from her overpowering
collaborator's shadow.<sup><a href="#f99">99</a></sup> Other examples include <span class="character" about="Lucca">Emilia Lucca</span>, whose
husband, <span class="character" about="Gennaro">Gennaro</span>, guarantees her safety and keeps her collaboration to a
minimum;<sup><a href="#f100">100</a></sup> <span class="character" about="Mary">Mary</span>, niece to <span class="character" about="Holder">Alexander Holder</span>, who is tempted by a no-
good lover to assist in stealing a valuable jewel;<sup><a href="#f101">101</a></sup> and <cite><span class="works" about="MusgraveRitual">The Musgrave
Ritual</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Howells">Rachel Howells</span>, persuaded to hunt an ancient treasure by her
ruthless lover and later driven mad by his betrayal to the point of murdering
him.<sup><a href="#f102">102</a></sup> <span class="character" about="Howells">Howells</span>'s actions are violently sensational and yet stem from
powerlessness and rejection; <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> describes this duality as follows:</p>

<blockquote>What smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into
        flame in this passionate Celtic woman's soul when she saw the
        man who had wronged her-wronged her, perhaps, far more than
        we suspected-in her power? Was it a chance that the wood had
        slipped and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become
        his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate?
        Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away
        and sent the slab crashing down into its place? Be that as it might,
        I seemed to see that woman's figure still clutching at her treasure
        trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with her ears ringing
        perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the
        drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was
        choking her faithless lover's life out.<br>
        Here was the secret of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her
        peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. But what had
        been in the box? What had she done with that? Of course, it must
        have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged
        from the mere. She had thrown them in there at the first
        opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime.<sup><a href="#f103">103</a></sup></blockquote>

<h4>2. Protectors</h4>

<p>A second large category of female characters commits transgressions in
order to protect loved ones. The most endearing of those is, perhaps, <cite><span class="works" about="YellowFace">The
Yellow Face</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Munro">Effie Munro</span>, who hides her black daughter for fear of her
husband's wrath)<sup><a href="#f104">104</a></sup> <span class="character" about="Munro">Munro</span>'s explanation of her behavior is typically
feminine: The dilemma she faces is choosing between her loyalty to a
loved daughter and a loved husband.</p>

<blockquote>"That is <span class="character" about="Hebron">John Hebron</span>, of <span class="places" about="Atlanta">Atlanta</span>," said the lady, "and a nobler man
        never walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in order to
        wed him, but never once while he lived did I for an instant regret it.
        It was our misfortune that our only child took after his people
        rather than mine. It is often so in such matches, and little <span class="character" about="Lucy">Lucy</span> is
        darker far than ever her father was. But dark or fair, she is my own
        dear little girlie, and her mother's pet." The little creature ran
        across at the words and nestled up against the lady's dress. "When
        I left her in America," she continued, "it was only because her
   health was weak, and the change might have done her harm. She
   was given to the care of a faithful Scotch woman who had once
   been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning
   her as my child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and
   I learned to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. God
   forgive me, I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the
   courage to tell you. I had to choose between you, and in my
   weakness I turned away from my own little girl. For three years I
   have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the
   nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. At last, however,
   there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I
   struggled against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger, I
   determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I
   sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions
   about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbor, without
   my appearing to be in any way connected with her. I pushed my
   precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house
   during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands so that
   even those who might see her at the window should not gossip
   about there being a black child in the neighborhood. If I had been
   less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy
   with fear that you should learn the truth."<sup><a href="#f105">105</a></sup><sup></blockquote>

<p>Either of the two choices, it should be noted, would confirm <span class="character" about="Munro">Munro</span>'s
adherence to a stereotypical female position. It is important, nonetheless,
to note that Munro does not face a dilemma between, say, her own
aspirations and a loved one. As presented in the story, <span class="character" about="Munro">Munro</span>'s choice to
hide the child speaks not so much of her gender, but of prevailing notions
of colonialism and race.</p>
<p>Another classic protector is <cite><span class="works" about="SecondStain">The Second Stain</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Trelawney">Lady Hilda Trelawney-
Hope</span>, who attempts to steal back state documents to protect her husband's
government career.<sup><a href="#f106">106</a></sup> The documents had been stolen by <span class="character" about="Trelawney">Lady Hope</span> from
her husband in order to sell them to a foreign agent, who was blackmailing
her using indiscreet romantic correspondence that preceded <span class="character" about="Trelawney">Lady Hope</span>'s
marriage. <sup><a href="#f107">107</a></sup> Her explanation of her crime is an example of the distinction
between the public realm of diplomacy, in which <span class="charachter" about="Trelawney">Hope</span> had no part or
share, and the private realm of feelings and domestic happiness.</p>

<blockquote>"Put yourself in my position, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Mr. Holmes</span>! What was I to do?"<br>
       "Take your husband into your confidence."<br>
      "I could not, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Mr. Holmes</span>, I could not! On the one side seemed
      certain ruin, on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my
      husband's paper, still in a matter of politics I could not understand
      the consequences, while in a matter of love and trust they were
      only too clear to me. I did it, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Mr. Holmes</span>! I took an impression of
      his key. This man, <span class="character" about="Lucas">Lucas, furnished a duplicate. I opened his
      despatch-box [sic], took the paper, and conveyed it to <span class="places" about="Godolphin">Godolphin
      Street</span>."<sup><a href="#f108">108</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Two additional characters-<cite><span class="works" about="AbbeyGrange">The Abbey Grange</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Brackenstall">Lady Brackenstall</span><sup><a href="#f109">109</a></sup>
and <cite><span class="works" about="CrookedMan">The Crooked Man</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="Barclay">Nancy Barclay</span><sup><a href="#f110">110</a></sup>-are also examples of
protectors. Each attempts to obstruct the investigation of her husband's
murder to protect the lover who committed the murder.</p>

<h4>3. Muses</h4>

<p>The last two examples, <span class="character" about="Brackenstall">Lady Brackenstall</span> and <span class="character" about="Barclay">Nancy Barclay</span>, can also
be classified as muses. They are women whose main role in the Holmesian
plot is to be objects of love or desire who drive their suitors, lovers, or
former husbands to commit crime. Importantly, their indirect roles in the
crimes are described by their respective lovers-the free agents who
committed the crimes. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> confronts the killer of <span class="character" about="ColonelBarclay">Colonel Barclay:</p>

<blockquote>"I have already heard of your meeting with <span class="character" about="Barclay">Mrs. Barclay</span>, and your
      mutual recognition. You then, as I understand, followed her home
      and saw through the window an altercation between her husband
      and her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth.
      Your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn and
      broke in upon them."<br>

      "I did, sir, and at the sight of me he looked as I have never seen a
      man look before, and over he went with his head on the fender.
      But he was dead before he fell. I read death on his face as plain as
      I can read that text over the fire. The bare sight of me was like a
      bullet through his guilty heart."<sup><a href="#f111">111</a></sup></blockquote>
<p><span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> provides a similar narrative for the killer of <span class="character" about="SirBrackenstall">Sir Eustace
Brackenstall:</p>
<blockquote>"Well, I never thought to see her again, but last voyage I was
      promoted, and the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait
      for a couple of months with my people at <span class="places" about="Sydenham">Sydenham</span>. One day out
       in a country lane I met <span class="character" about="Wright">Theresa Wright</span>, her old maid. She told me
       all about her, about him, about everything. I tell you, gentlemen, it
       nearly drove me mad. This drunken hound, that he should dare to
       raise his hand to her, whose boots he was not worthy to lick! . . . I
       crept round there last night and scratched at the window. At first
       she would not open to me, but in her heart I know that now she
       loves me, and she could not leave me in the frosty night. She
       whispered to me to come round to the big front window, and I
       found it open before me, so as to let me into the dining-room.
       Again I heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil,
       and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman I loved.
       Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window, in
       all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman
       into the room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a
       woman, and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his
       hand. I had sprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between
       us. See here, on my arm, where his first blow fell. Then it was my
       turn, and I went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin.
       Do you think I was sorry? Not I! It was his life or mine, but far
       more than that, it was his life or hers, for how could I leave her in
       the power of this madman? That was how I killed him. Was I
       wrong? Well, then, what would either of you gentlemen have
       done, if you had been in my position?"<sup><a href="#f112">112</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, after consulting with <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>, whom he perceives to be
<q>eminently fitted</q> to represent a British jury, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> decides to <q>acquit</q>
the perpetrator. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> sees the perpetrator as the savior of an innocent
damsel in distress rather than a scoundrel, and allow him to escape the
authorities.<sup><a href="#f113">113</a></sup></p>

<p>While both women -<span class="character" about="Barclay">Mrs. Barclay</span> and <span class="character" about="Brackenstall">Lady Brackenstall</span>- hide the
identity of the perpetrator from law enforcement agents, their own agency
in the story is limited to serving as the inspiration and muse for men's
altercations.</p>

<h4>4. Entrepreneurs</h4>

<p>As <span class="people" about="Lacey">Lacey</span> suggests, the entrepreneurial free agent image did not
entirely disappear from cultural crime narratives even late in the nineteenth
century. As demonstrated in <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span>'s stories, such examples are not rare,
but their representation undergoes transformation, particularly in the later
stories.</p>

<p>The quintessential example of an entrepreneurial, independent female
adversary is, of course, <cite><span class="works" about="ScandalBohemia">A Scandal in Bohemia</span></cite>'s <span class="character" about="IreneAdler">Irene Adler</span> -the
<q>adventuress</q> who captured the heart of <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s client, the <span class="character" about="KBohemia">King of
Bohemia</span>. In a fascinating reversal of the more common <q>damsel in
distress</q> scenario, it is the man who comes to <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> for help, asking him
to retrieve a photograph in Adler's possession, in order to save his
impending marriage. <span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> provides Adler with an artistic, class-defying
biography, which frees her to engage with kings and solicitors, and to move
freely across the demographic divide.</p>
      <blockquote>"Let me see!" said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. "Hum! Born in <span class="places" about="NewJersey">New Jersey</span> in the
      year 1858. Contralto-hum! <span class="places" about="LaScala">La Scala</span>, hum! Prima donna <span class="places" about="Warsaw">Imperial Opera of Warsaw</span>- yes! Retired from operatic stage-ha!
      Living in <span class="places" about="London">London</span>- quite so!"<sup><a href="#f114">114</a></sup></blockquote>

<p><span class="character" about="IreneAdler">Adler</span> proves a worthy adversary to <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. While <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> succeeds
in locating the photograph, <span class="character" about="IreneAdler">Adler</span> eventually fools and defeats him when, in
the ultimate act of gender transgression, she dares to greet him in the street
dressed as a man.<sup><a href="#f115">115</a></sup> In a letter to her adversary, she explains:<p>

<blockquote>"But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male
        costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the
        freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
        ran upstairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came
        down just as you departed."<sup><a href="#f116">116</a></sup></blockquote>

<p><span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> is extremely impressed with <span class="character" about="IreneAdler">Adler</span>. The following exchange,
defying notions of class and nobility, is telling:</p>
<blockquote>"What a woman-oh, what a woman!" cried the <span class="charachter" about="KBohemia">King of Bohemia</span>,
        when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how
        quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an
        admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"<br>
        "From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
        very different level to your <span class="character" about="KBohemia">Majesty</span>," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> coldly.<sup><a href="#f117">117</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s mind, therefore, the <span class="charachter" about="KBohemia">king</span>'s vacuous, pompous mannerisms
are clearly inferior to <span class="charachter" about="IreneAdler">Irene</span>'s resourcefulness and courage.</p>

<p>The <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> canon includes other well-developed
independent female characters. One such character is <span class="charachter" about="Klein">Isadora Klein</span> from
<cite><span class="works" about="ThreeGables">The Three Gables</span></cite>, whose solution to the prospect of being defamed by a
young novelist-attempting to buy all copies of the novel, as well as the
house where the last copy is located, and then hiring rougher hands to
discourage him from publishing-are nothing if not entrepreneurial. In
<span class="charachter" about="Klein">Klein</span>'s case, it is wealth rather than a class-transcending background that
awards her free agency. However, that should not be taken to mean that
<span class="people" about="Doyle">Doyle</span> casts wealth as inherently providing freedom. Other female
characters in the <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> canon (like <span class="charachter" about="Saxe-Meningen">Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-
Meningen</span>, King Wilhelm's fiancee,<sup><a href="#f118">118</a></sup> and <span class="charachter" about="deMerville">Violet de Merville</span>, <span class="charachter" about="Gruner">Baron
Gruner</span>'s fiancee<sup><a href="#f119">119</a></sup>) are female <q>in a golden cage,</q> frozen, flat,
and colorless in their noble and affluent backgrounds. And, notably,
<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>'s warning to <span class="charachter" about="Klein">Klein</span> is a clear example of gender stereotyping.
While chivalrously allowing her to escape the law unscathed, he warns her
of the consequences of her unladylike behavior.</p>
<blockquote>"Meantime, lady"-he wagged a cautionary forefinger-"have a
       care! Have a care! You can't play with edged tools forever
       without cutting those dainty hands."<sup><a href="#f120">120</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>It is worth pointing out that male adversaries are not treated to such
concerned advice in the <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> oeuvre. The difference between <span class="charachter" about="IreneAdler">Irene
Adler</span> and <span class="charachter" about="Klein">Isadora Klein</span> may be attributable to the amount of time between
the two publications. <cite><span class="works" about="ScandalBohemia">A Scandal in Bohemia</span></cite> was published in 1891 and
<cite><span class="works" about="ThreeGables">The Three Gables</span></cite> in 1926. It may be that the transformation in attitude
toward <q>Moll-esque</q> characters was an ongoing process well into the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>Several female criminals engage in sensational crimes of passion,
echoing those reported in contemporary news.<sup><a href="#f121">121</a></sup> Among these are <span class="charachter" about="Winter">Kitty
Winter</span>, who engages in the quintessential nineteenth century female
passion crime-throwing vitriol in the face of her cruel former lover;<sup><a href="#f122">122</a></sup>
<span class="charachter" about="Gibson">Mrs. Gibson</span> from <cite><span class="works" about="ThorBridge">The Problem of Thor Bridge</span></cite>, who cleverly crafts her
suicide to frame her husband's new mistress;<sup><a href="#f123">123</a></sup> and a distinguished
woman, whose identity remains undisclosed, who shoots the known
blackmailer <span class="charachter" about="Milverton">Charles Augustus Milverton</span>.<sup><a href="#f124">124</a></sup> It is debatable whether these
women operate as free agents. While their crimes are violent, sensational,
and daring, they are perpetrated from a position of despair and
victimization. These are, for the most part, desperate acts of revenge. In
<span class="charachter" about="Gibson">Mrs. Gibson</span>'s case, her crime includes her own death. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> ties her
sensational plot to her femininity:</p>

<blockquote>"It must be admitted that the workings of this unhappy woman's
       mind were deep and subtle, so that it was no very simple matter to
       unravel her plot. I do not think that in our adventures we have ever
       come across a stranger example of what perverted love can bring
       about. Whether <span class="charachter" about="Dunbar">Miss Dunbar</span> was her rival in a physical or in a
       merely mental sense seems to have been equally unforgivable in
       her eyes. No doubt she blamed this innocent lady for all those
       harsh dealings and unkind words with which her husband tried to
       repel her too demonstrative affection. Her first resolution was to
       end her own life. Her second was to do it in such a way as to
       involve her victim in a fate which was worse far than any sudden
       death could be."<sup><a href="#f125">125</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Despite the desperation behind these crimes, they serve as a reminder
that even in situations with impossible choices, resorting to crime is in and
of itself a freely chosen path, albeit an extreme and tragic one.</p>
<p>Another category of active female characters, though a far cry from
<span class="charachter" about="IreneAdler">Irene Adler</span>, are women who are <q>captive</q> and nonetheless try to subvert
their     powerlessness      by     providing     warnings     against   their
captors/lovers/accomplices to others. <span class="charachter" about="Elsie">Elsie</span> tries to warn the engineer
against remaining in the counterfeiter's house. <span class="charachter" about="Sophia">Sophia</span>, at great risk to
herself, attempts to rescue her brother from their oppressors. Lastly, <span class="charachter" about="Stapleton">Beryl
Stapleton</span> tries to warn <span class="charachter" about="Baskerville">Sir Henry Baskerville</span> from her scheming,
murderous husband. While women like <span class="charachter" about="IreneAdler">Irene Adler</span> and <span class="charachter" about="Klein">Isadora Klein</span> act
from a position of freedom and independence, these three women try to
subvert their powerlessness by doing what little is in their power: warning
others against their captors.</p>
