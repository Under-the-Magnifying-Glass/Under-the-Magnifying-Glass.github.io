              <p>
              To <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>  she is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard him
              mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
              predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any
              emotion akin to love for <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Irene Adler</span>. All emotions, and that one
              particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably
              balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and
              observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would
              have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer
              passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things
              for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives
              and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions
              into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to
              introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his
              mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of
              his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong
              emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to
              him, and that woman was the late Irene <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler,</span> of dubious and
              questionable memory.</p><p>     I had seen little of <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> lately. My marriage had drifted us away
              from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
              interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
              of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
              while <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, who loathed every form of society with his whole
              Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>, buried among
              his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and
              ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his
              own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study
              of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers
              of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
              mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official
              police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:
              of his summons to <span class="places" about="Odessa">Odessa</span> in the case of <span class="citedCase" about="TrepoffMurder">the Trepoff murder</span>, of his
              clearing up of the singular <span class="citedCase" about="Atkinson">tragedy of the Atkinson brothers</span> at <span class="places" about="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</span>
              , and finally of the <span class="citedCase" about="ReigningFamily">mission</span> which he had accomplished so
              delicately and successfully for the reigning family of <span class="places" about="Holland">Holland</span>.
              Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared
              with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former
              friend and companion. </p><p>     One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning
              from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
              practice), when my way led me through <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>. As I passed the
              well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with
              my wooing, and with the dark incidents of <span class="works" about="StudyScarlet">the Study in Scarlet</span>, I was
              seized with a keen desire to see <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> again, and to know how he was
              employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,
              and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in
              a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,
              eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped
              behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude
              and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen
              out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
              problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had
              formerly been in part my own.</p><p>
              His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
              to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
              me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
              spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the
              fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</p>

              </figure>
              <p>     "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>, that you have put
              on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."</p><p>     "Seven!" I answered.</p><p>     "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
              fancy, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span> . And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
              that you intended to go into harness."</p><p>     "Then, how do you know?"</p><p>     "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
              yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
              careless servant girl?"</p><p>   "My dear <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> ," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have
              been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had
              a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
              have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to <span class="character" about="MaryJane">Mary Jane</span>
              , she is incorrigible, and <span class="fcharacter" about="MrsWatson">my wife</span> has given her notice, but
              there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."
              </p><p>     He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
              </p><p>    "It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
              inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the
              leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have
              been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the
              edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you
              see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and
              that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the
              <span class="places" about="London"> London </span> slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my
              rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver
              upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his
              top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be
              dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the
              medical profession."

              I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
              process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
              remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
              simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive
              instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your
              process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."</p><p>     "Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
              down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The
              distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
              which lead up from the hall to this room."</p><p>     "Frequently."</p><p>     "How often?"</p><p>     "Well, some hundreds of times."</p><p>     "Then how many are there?"</p><p>     "How many? I don't know."</p><p>     "Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
              my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
              both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these
              little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or
              two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He
              threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been
              lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read
              it aloud."</p><p>     The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</p><p>     "There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,"
              it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the
              very deepest moment.
              <span class="citedCase" about="ReigningFamily"> Your recent services to one of the royal houses
              of Europe</span> have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
              matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
              This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
              chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
              wear a mask."</p><p>     "This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it
              means?"</p><p>     "I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one
              has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,
              instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you
              deduce from it?"</p><p>     I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
              written.</p>
              <figure>

              <figcaption><i>I carefully examined the writing.</i></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>     "The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
              endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could
              not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong
              and stiff."</p><p>     "Peculiar--that is the very word," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. "It is not an English
              paper at all. Hold it up to the light."</p><p>     I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large
              "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.</p><p>     "What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.</p><p>     "The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."</p><p>     "Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,'
              which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like
              our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let
              us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown
              volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is
              in a German-speaking country--in <span class="places" about="Bohemia"> Bohemia</span>, not far from <span class="places" about="Carlsbad"> Carlsbad</span>Carlsbad.
              'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for
              its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what
              do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
              triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</p><p>     "The paper was made in <span class="places" about="Bohemia"> Bohemia</span>," I said.</p><p>     "Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note
              the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we
              have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not
              have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his
              verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this
              German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to
              showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve
              all our doubts."</p><p>     As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating
              wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes
              whistled.</p><p>     "A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of
              the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
              and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case,<span class="character" about="Watson"> Watson</span>, if
              there is nothing else."</p><p>     "I think that I had better go,<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>."</p><p>     "Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
              And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."</p><p>     "But your client--"</p><p>     "Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
              Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."</p><p>     A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in
              the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a
              loud and authoritative tap.</p><p>     "Come in!" said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>.</p><p>     A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
              inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress
              was rich with a richness which would, in <span class="places" about="England"> England</span>, be looked upon as
              akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the
              sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue
              cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with
              flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which
              consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up
              his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,
              completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by
              his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,
              while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past
              the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted
              that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.
              From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong
              character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin
              suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.</p>

              <figcaption><i>A man entered.</i></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>     "You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
              marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from
              one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.</p><p>     "Pray take a seat," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. "This is my friend and colleague,
              <span class="character" about="Watson"> Dr. Watson</span>, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.
              Whom have I the honour to address?"</p><p>     "You may address me as the <span class="character" about="King">Count Von Kramm</span>, a Bohemian nobleman. I
              understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
              discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
              importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
              alone."</p><p>     I rose to go, but <span class="character" about="Sherlock"> Holmes</span> caught me by the wrist and pushed me back
              into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before
              this gentleman anything which you may say to me."</p><p>     The <span class="character" about="King">Count</span> shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he,
              "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
              that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not
              too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence
              upon European history."</p><p>     "I promise," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>.</p><p>     "And I."</p><p>     "You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
              august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,
              and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called
              myself is not exactly my own."</p><p>     "I was aware of it," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> dryly.</p><p>     "The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
              be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
              seriously compromise one of the reigning families of <span class="places" about="Europe">Europe</span>. To speak
              plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein,
              hereditary kings of  <span class="places" about="Bohemia">Bohemia</span>."</p><p>     "I was also aware of that," murmured <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, settling himself down in
              his armchair and closing his eyes.</p><p>     Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
              lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as
              the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in <span class="places" about="Europe">Europe</span>. <span class="character" about="Holmes">Holmes</span>
              slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic
              client.</p><p>     "If your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> would condescend to state your case," he remarked,
              "I should be better able to advise you."</p><p>     The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
              uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
              tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are

              <p>     "Why, indeed?" murmured <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. "Your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> had not spoken before I
              was aware that I was addressing  <span class="character" about="King">Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von

              more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can
              understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
              person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
              an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito
              from <span class="places" about="Prague">Prague</span> for the purpose of consulting you."</p><p>     "Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</p><p>     "The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
              visit to <span class="places" about="Warsaw">Warsaw</span>, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
              adventuress, <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Irene Adler</span>. The name is no doubt familiar to you."</p><p>     "Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> without
              opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
              all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
              name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
              information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
              that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written
              a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.</p><p>     "Let me see!" said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>. "Hum! Born in <span class="places" about="New Jersey">New Jersey</span> in the year 1858.

              that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of
              steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind
              of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another
              woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."</p><p>     "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"</p><p>     "I am sure."</p><p>     "And why?"</p><p>     "Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
              betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."</p><p>     "Oh, then we have three days yet," said <span class="fcharacter" about="Lothman">Holmes</span> with a yawn. "That is
              very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look

              laid it on the table.</p><p>     "There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,"
              he said.</p><p>     <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed
              it to him.</p><p>     "And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.</p><p>     "Is <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood</span>."</p><p>     <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span> took a note of it.

              some good news for you. And good-night, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>," he added, as the
              wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be
              good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should
              like to chat this little matter over with you."</p>

              <h3><a name="secondo">CHAPTER II</a></h3>

              <p> At three o'clock precisely I was at <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>, but<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>had not
              yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
              shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the
              fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he
              might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though
              it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
              associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,
              the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it
              a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
              investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
              masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning,
              which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to
              follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
              inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success
              that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my
              head.</p><p>     It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
              groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
              disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my
              friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three
              times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he
              vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
              tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
              pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
              heartily for some minutes.</p>

              <figcaption><i>A drunken-looking groom.</i></figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>     "Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until
              he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.</p><p>     "What is it?"</p><p>     "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
              my morning, or what I ended by doing."</p><p>     "I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits,
              and perhaps the house, of Miss <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler"> Irene Adler</span>."</p><p>     "Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
              however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning
              in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful
              sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you
              will know all that there is to know. I soon found <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>. It is
              a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front
              right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large
              sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows
              almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners
              which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save
              that the passage window could be reached from the top of the
              coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every
              point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.</p><p>     "I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there
              was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I
              lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
              exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag
              tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler"> Adler</span>,
              to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in
              whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was
              compelled to listen to."</p><p>     "And what of Irene <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler?</span>" I asked.</p><p>     "Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the
              daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
              Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
              drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.
              Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one
              male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and
              dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a
              Mr. Godfrey  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span>, of the Inner  <span class="places" about="Temple">Temple</span>. See the advantages of a
              cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from
              Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all
              they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span> once
              more, and to think over my plan of campaign.</p><p>     "This Godfrey  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span> was evidently an important factor in the matter.
              He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between
              them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
              his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably
              transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less
              likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should
              continue my work at <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>, or turn my attention to the
              gentleman's chambers in the  <span class="places" about="Temple">Temple</span>. It was a delicate point, and it
              widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
              details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
              to understand the situation."</p><p>     "I am following you closely," I answered.</p><p>     "I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove
              up to <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
              handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of
              whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the
              cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with
              the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.</p><p>     "He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses
              of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down,
              talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing.
              Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he
              stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and
              looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to
              Gross & Hankey's in  <span class="places" about="RegentStreet">Regent Street</span>, and then to the Church of
              <span class="places" about="StMonica">St. Monica</span> in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty
              minutes!'</p><p>     "Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
              well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the
              coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,
              while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.
              It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.
              I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely
              woman, with a face that a man might die for.</p><p>     "'The Church of  <span class="places" about="StMonica">St. Monica</span>, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign
              if you reach it in twenty minutes.'</p><p>     "This was quite too good to lose, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>. I was just balancing
              whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
              landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at
              such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The
              Church of  <span class="places" about="StMonica">St. Monica</span>,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it
              in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of
              course it was clear enough what was in the wind.</p><p>     "My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
              others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
              steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the
              man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the
              two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be
              expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in
              front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler
              who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at
              the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span> came running as hard
              as he could towards me.</p><p>     "'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'</p><p>     "'What then?' I asked.</p><p>     "'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'</p><p>     "I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I
              found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
              vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting
              in the secure tying up of Irene <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler,</span> spinster, to Godfrey  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span>,
              bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
              thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
              clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous
              position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the
              thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there
              had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman
              absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and
              that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally
              out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a
              sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the
              occasion."</p>

              <p>     "This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"</p><p>     "Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the
              pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very
              prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door,
              however, they separated, he driving back to the  <span class="places" about="Temple">Temple</span>, and she to
              her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she
              said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different
              directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."</p><p>     "Which are?"</p><p>     "Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell.
              "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier
              still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your
              co-operation."</p><p>     "I shall be delighted."</p><p>     "You don't mind breaking the law?"</p><p>     "Not in the least."</p><p>     "Nor running a chance of arrest?"</p><p>     "Not in a good cause."</p><p>     "Oh, the cause is excellent!"</p><p>     "Then I am your man."</p><p>     "I was sure that I might rely on you."</p><p>     "But what is it you wish?"</p><p>     "When <span class="fcharacter" about="MrsTurner">Mrs. Turner</span> has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
              you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
              landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
              much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the
              scene of action. Miss <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler" >Irene</span>, or Madame, rather, returns from her
              drive at seven. We must be at <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span> to meet her."</p><p>     "And what then?"</p><p>     "You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
              There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not
              interfere, come what may. You understand?"</p><p>     "I am to be neutral?"</p><p>     "To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
              unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
              into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room
              window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open
              window."</p><p>     "Yes."</p><p>     "You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."</p><p>     "Yes."</p><p>     "And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I
              give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.
              You quite follow me?"</p><p>     "Entirely."</p><p>     "It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
              roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,
              fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task
              is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be
              taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of
              the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have
              made myself clear?"</p><p>     "I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
              the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire,
              and to wait you at the corner of the street."</p><p>     "Precisely."</p><p>     "Then you may entirely rely on me."</p><p>     "That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
              prepare for the new role I have to play."</p><p>     He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
              character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.
              His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his
              sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent
              curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It
              was not merely that<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>changed his costume. His expression, his
              manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he
              assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute
              reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.</p>

              <p>     It was a quarter past six when we left  <span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street,</span> and it still
              wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
              Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
              we paced up and down in front of <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>, waiting for the coming
              of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
              <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes'</span> succinct description, but the locality appeared to
              be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street
              in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a
              group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
              scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with
              a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up
              and down with cigars in their mouths.</p><p>     "You see," remarked <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the
              house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph
              becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be
              as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span>, as our client is
              to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is--Where
              are we to find the photograph?"</p><p>     "Where, indeed?"</p><p>     "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
              cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.
              She knows that the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> is capable of having her waylaid and
              searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may
              take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."</p><p>     "Where, then?"</p><p>     "Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
              inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they
              like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone
              else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell
              what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
              business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it
              within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It
              must be in her own house."</p><p>     "But it has twice been burgled."</p><p>     "Pshaw! They did not know how to look."</p><p>     "But how will you look?"</p><p>     "I will not look."</p><p>     "What then?"</p><p>     "I will get her to show me."</p><p>     "But she will refuse."</p><p>     "She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
              carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."</p><p>     As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the
              curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
              the door of <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
              the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
              copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up
              with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was
              increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the
              loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the
              other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had
              stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed
              and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their
              fists and sticks.<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>dashed into the crowd to protect the lady;
              but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground,
              with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the
              guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in
              the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched
              the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady
              and to attend to the injured man. Irene <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler,</span> as I will still call
              her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
              superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back
              into the street.</p>

              <p>     "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.</p><p>     "He is dead," cried several voices.</p><p>     "No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone
              before you can get him to hospital."</p><p>     "He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's
              purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a
              rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."</p><p>     "He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"</p><p>     "Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
              sofa. This way, please!"</p><p>     Slowly and solemnly he was borne into <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span> and laid out in
              the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my
              post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not
              been drawn, so that I could see<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>as he lay upon the couch. I do
              not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for
              the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily
              ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature
              against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which
              she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest
              treachery to<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>to draw back now from the part which he had
              intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from
              under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We
              are but preventing her from injuring another.</p><p>    <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
              is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
              the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed
              my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner
              out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
              ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids--joined in a general
              shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and
              out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a
              moment later the voice of<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>from within assuring them that it
              was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way
              to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find
              my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He
              walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had
              turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware
              Road.</p><p>     "You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have
              been better. It is all right."</p><p>     "You have the photograph?"</p><p>     "I know where it is."</p><p>     "And how did you find out?"</p><p>     "She showed me, as I told you she would."</p><p>     "I am still in the dark."</p><p>     "I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was
              perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
              an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."</p><p>     "I guessed as much."</p><p>     "Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
              palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
              face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."</p><p>     "That also I could fathom."</p><p>     "Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
              could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
              which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
              determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air,
              they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."</p><p>     "How did that help you?"</p><p>     "It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
              her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.
              It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once
              taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution
              scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle
              business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches
              for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had
              nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest
              of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably
              done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel.
              She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a
              sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an
              instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I
              cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the
              rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose,
              and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether
              to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
              come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait.
              A little over-precipitance may ruin all."</p><p>     "And now?" I asked.</p><p>     "Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>
              to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
              shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable
              that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It
              might be a satisfaction to his  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> to regain it with his own
              hands."</p><p>     "And when will you call?"</p><p>     "At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
              clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
              complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>
              without delay."</p><p>     We had reached<span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>and had stopped at the door. He was
              searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:</p><p>     "Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."</p>

              <p>     There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the

              hurried by.</p><p>     "I've heard that voice before," said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, staring down the dimly

              <p>     I slept at<span class="places" about="BakerStreet">Baker Street</span>that night, and we were engaged upon our
              toast and coffee in the morning when the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> of<span class="places" about="Bohemia">Bohemia</span>  rushed into
              the room.</p><p>     "You have really got it!" he cried, grasping<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>by
              either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.</p><p>     "Not yet."</p><p>     "But you have hopes?"</p><p>     "I have hopes."</p><p>     "Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."</p><p>     "We must have a cab."</p><p>     "No, my brougham is waiting."</p><p>     "Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once
              more for <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span>.</p><p>     "<span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Irene Adler</span>is married," remarked Holmes.</p><p>     "Married! When?"</p><p>     "Yesterday."</p><p>     "But to whom?"</p><p>     "To an English lawyer named  <span class="character" about="Norton">Norton</span>."</p><p>     "But she could not love him."</p><p>     "I am in hopes that she does."</p><p>     "And why in hopes?"</p><p>     "Because it would spare your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> all fear of future annoyance. If
              the lady loves her husband, she does not love your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>. If she
              does not love your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>, there is no reason why she should
              interfere with your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>'s plan."</p><p>     "It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
              What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence,
              which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.</p><p>     The door of <span class="places" about="BrionyLodge">Briony Lodge</span> was open, and an elderly woman stood upon
              the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
              brougham.</p><p>     "Mr. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>, I believe?" said she.</p><p>     "I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
              questioning and rather startled gaze.</p><p>     "Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left
              this morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from <span class="places" about="CharingCross">Charing Cross</span>
              for the <span class="places" about="America">Continent</span>."</p><p>     "What!"<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>staggered back, white with chagrin and
              surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"</p><p>     "Never to return."</p><p>     "And the papers?" asked the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> hoarsely. "All is lost."</p><p>     "We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
              drawing-room, followed by the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> and myself. The furniture was
              scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
              drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her
              flight.<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding
              shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a
              letter. The photograph was of<span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Irene Adler</span>herself in evening dress,
              the letter was superscribed to "<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>, Esq. To be left till
              called for." My friend tore it open and we all three read it
              together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in
              this way:</p><p>     "My dear Mr. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>:
              "You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after
              the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how
              I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against
              you months ago. I had been told that if the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> employed an agent it
              would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with
              all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I
              became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
              old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
              myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of
              the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
              ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came
              down just as you departed.
              "Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
              really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>.
              Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
              the  <span class="places" about="Temple">Temple</span> to see my husband.
              "We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
              formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
              call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.
              I love and am loved by a better man than he. The  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> may do what he
              will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep
              it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will
              always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I
              leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear
              Mr. <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span>,
              "Very truly yours,
              "Irene  Norton, née <span class="fcharacter" about="Adler">Adler</span>."</p><p>     "What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> of <span class="places" about="Bohemia">Bohemia</span>, when we
              had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and
              resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it
              not a pity that she was not on my level?" </p><p>     "From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very
              different level to your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>," said<span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>coldly. "I am sorry
              that I have not been able to bring your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>'s business to a more
              successful conclusion."</p><p>     "On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span>; "nothing could be
              more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is
              now as safe as if it were in the fire."</p><p>     "I am glad to hear your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> say so."</p><p>     "I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
              reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his
              finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</p><p>     "Your  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> has something which I should value even more highly,"
              said <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>.</p><p>     "You have but to name it."</p><p>     "This photograph!"</p>

              matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He bowed,
              and, turning away without observing the hand which the  <span class="character" about="King">King</span> had
              stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.</p><p>     And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of

              a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women,
              but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene

                <h1>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.</h1>
                <h2>XVIII. - THE ADVENTURE OF THE THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL.</h2>
                <h3>BY A. CONAN DOYLE.</h3>

                <p>An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
                <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> was that, although in his methods of thought he was
                the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
                affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
                his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
                fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
                in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in <span class="places" about="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>,
                coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
                me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
                limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
                coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
                his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
                very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
                virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
                be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, in one of his
                queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
                hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
                a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
                the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.<p>

                <p>Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics
                which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning
                up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places. But his
                papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying documents,
                especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it
                was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to
                docket and arrange them; for, as I have mentioned somewhere in these
                incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he
                performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were
                followed by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about
                with his violin and his books, hardly moving save from the sofa to
                the table. Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every
                corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were
                on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by
                their owner.</p>
                <p>One winter's night, as we sat together by the fire, I
                ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts
                into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in
                making our room a little more habitable. He could not deny the
                justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to
                his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box
                behind him. This he placed in the middle of the floor and, squatting
                down upon a stool in front of it, he threw back the lid. I could see
                that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red
                tape into separate packages.</p>

                <p><q>There are cases enough here, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>,</q> said he, looking at me with
                mischievous eyes. <q>I think that if you knew all that I had in this
                box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in.</q></p>

                <p><q>These are the records of your early work, then?</q> I asked. <q>I have
                often wished that I had notes of those cases.</q></p>

                <p><q>Yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my biographer
                had come to glorify me.</q> He lifted bundle after bundle in a tender,
                caressing sort of way. <q>They are not all successes, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>,</q> said he.
                <q>but there are some pretty little problems among them. Here's the
                record of the <span class="citedCase" about="Tarleton">Tarleton murders</span>, and the <span class="citedCase" about="Vamberry">case of Vamberry</span>, <span class="citedCase" about="wineMerchant">the wine
                merchant</span>, and <span class="citedCase" about="russianWoman">the adventure of the old Russian woman</span>, and <span class="citedCase" about="aluminiumCrutch">the
                singular affair of the aluminium crutch</span>, as well as a full account of
                <span class="citedCase" about="Ricoletti">Ricoletti</span> of the club-foot, and his abominable wife. And here--ah,
                now, this really is something a little recherche.</q></p>

                <p>He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up a
                small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children's toys are kept
                in. From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper, an
                old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string attached
                to it, and three rusty old disks of metal.</p>

                <p><q>Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?</q> he asked, smiling at my
                expression.</p>

                <p><q>It is a curious collection.</q></p>

                <p><q>Very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as
                being more curious still.</q></p>

                <p><q>These relics have a history then?</q></p>

                <p><q>So much so that they are history.</q></p>

                <p><q>What do you mean by that?</q></p>

                <p><span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> picked them up one by one, and laid them along the
                edge of the table. Then he reseated himself in his chair and looked
                them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</p>

                <p><q>These,</q> said he, <q>are all that I have left to remind me of the
                adventure of the Musgrave Ritual.</q></p>

                <p>I had heard him mention the case more than once, though I had never
                been able to gather the details.</p>
                <p><q>I should be so glad,</q> said I, <q>you would give me an account of it.</q></p>

                <p><q>And leave the litter as it is?</q> he cried, mischievously. <q>Your
                tidiness won't bear much strain after all, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>. But I should be
                glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there are
                points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of
                this or, I believe, of any other country. A collection of my trifling
                achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account
                of this very singular business.</q></p>
                <figure><img src="#Musgrave1" alt="MusgraveRitual1_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>A curious collection</figcaption></figure>

                <p><q>You may remember how <span class="citedCase" about="affairGloria">the affair of the <i>Gloria Scott</i></span>, and my
                conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first
                turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has
                become my life's work. You see me now when my name has become known
                far and wide, and when I am generally recognized both by the public
                and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in
                doubtful cases. Even when you knew me first, at the time of the
                affair which you have commemorated in <cite><span class="works" about="StudyScarlet">A Study in Scarlet,</cite> I had
                already established a considerable, though not a very lucrative,
                connection. You can hardly realize, then, how difficult I found it at
                first, and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any
                headway.</q></p>

                <p><q>When I first came up to <span class="places" about="London">London</span> I had rooms in <span class="places" about="MontagueStreet">Montague Street</span>, just
                round the corner from the <span class="works" about="British">British Museum</span>, and there I waited, filling
                in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of
                science which might make me more efficient. Now and again cases came
                in my way, principally through the introduction of old
                fellow-students, for during my last years at the University there was
                a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods. The third of
                these cases was that of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the
                interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events, and the
                large issues which proved to be at stake, that I trace my first
                stride towards the position which I now hold</q></p>

                <p><q><span class="charachter" about="RMusgrave">Reginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I had
                some slight acquaintance with him. He was not generally popular among
                the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set
                down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural
                diffidence. In appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic
                type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly
                manners. He was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in
                the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated
                from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and
                had established itself in western Sussex, where the Manor House of
                Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county.
                Something of his birth place seemed to cling to the man, and I never
                looked at his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without
                associating him with gray archways and mullioned windows and all the
                venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into
                talk, and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen
                interest in my methods of observation and inference.</q></p>

                <p><q>For four years I had seen nothing of him until one morning he walked
                into my room in <span class="works" about="MontagueStreet">Montague Street</span>. He had changed little, was dressed
                like a young man of fashion--he was always a bit of a dandy--and
                preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had formerly
                distinguished him.</q></p>

                <p><q>'How has all gone with you <span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Musgrave</span>?' I asked, after we had
                cordially shaken hands.</q></p>

                <p><q>"'You probably heard of my poor father's death,' said he; 'he was
                carried off about two years ago. Since then I have of course had the
                Hurlstone estates to manage, and as I am member for my district as
                well, my life has been a busy one. But I understand, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, that you
                are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to
                amaze us?'</q></p>

                <p><q>'Yes,' said I, 'I have taken to living by my wits.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be
                exceedingly valuable to me. We have had some very strange doings at
                <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>, and the police have been able to throw no light upon the
                matter. It is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable
                business.'</q></p>

                <figure><img src="#Musgrave2" alt="MusgraveRitual2_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>Reginald Musgrave</figcaption></figure>

                <p><q>You can imagine with what eagerness I listened to him, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>, for
                the very chance for which I had been panting during all those months
                of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. In my inmost heart I
                believed that I could succeed where others failed, and now I had the
                opportunity to test myself.</q></p>

                <p><q>'Pray, let me have the details,' I cried.</q></p>

                <p><q><span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Reginald Musgrave</span> sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette
                which I had pushed towards him.</q></p>

                <p><q>'You must know,' said he, 'that though I am a bachelor, I have to
                keep up a considerable staff of servants at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>, for it is a
                rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after. I
                , too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a
                house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. Altogether
                there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy.
                The garden and the stables of course have a separate staff.</q></p>

                <p><q>'Of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was
                Brunton the butler. He was a young school-master out of place when he
                was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of great energy and
                character, and he soon became quite invaluable in the household. He
                was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though
                he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty
                now. With his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts--for he
                can speak several languages and play nearly every musical
                instrument--it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so
                long in such a position, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and
                lacked energy to make any change. The butler of <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span> is always a
                thing that is remembered by all who visit us.</q></p>

                <p><q>'But this paragon has one fault. He is a bit of a Don Juan, and you
                can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part
                to play in a quiet country district. When he was married it was all
                right, but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble
                with him. A few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to
                settle down again for he became engaged to <span class="character" about="Howells">Rachel Howells</span>, our second
                house-maid; but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with
                <span class="character" about="Tragellis">Janet Tregellis</span>, the daughter of the head game-keeper. <span class="charachter" about="Rachel">Rachel</span>--who is
                a very good girl, but of an excitable Welsh temperament--had a sharp
                touch of brain-fever, and goes about the house now--or did until
                yesterday--like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. That was our
                first drama at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>; but a second one came to drive it from our
                minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler
                Brunton.</q></p>

                <p><q>'This was how it came about. I have said that the man was
                intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for it
                seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did
                not in the least concern him. I had no idea of the lengths to which
                this would carry him, until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.</q></p>

                <p><q>'I have said that the house is a rambling one. One day last week--on
                Thursday night, to be more exact--I found that I could not sleep,
                having foolishly taken a cup of strong cafe noir after my dinner.
                After struggling against it until two in the morning, I felt that it
                was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention
                of continuing a novel which I was reading. The book, however, had
                been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and
                started off to get it.</q></p>

                <p><q>'In order to reach the billiard-room I had to descend a flight of
                stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to the
                library and the gun-room. You can imagine my surprise when, as I
                looked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light coming from the
                open door of the library. I had myself extinguished the lamp and
                closed the door before coming to bed. Naturally my first thought was
                of burglars. The corridors at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span> have their walls largely
                decorated with trophies of old weapons. From one of these I picked a
                battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on tiptoe
                down the passage and peeped in at the open door.</q></p>

                <p><q>'<span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>, the butler, was in the library. He was sitting, fully
                dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked like a
                map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in
                deep thought. I stood dumb with astonishment, watching him from the
                darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light
                which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. Suddenly, as I
                looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the
                side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From this he
                took a paper, and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside
                the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute
                attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family
                documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward, and <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>,
                looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet,
                his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the
                chart-like paper which he had been originally studying.</q></p>

                <p><q>'So!' said I. 'This is how you repay the trust which we have
                reposed in you. You will leave my service to-morrow.</q></p>

                <figure><img src="#Musgrave3" alt="MusgraveRitual3_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>He sprang to his feet</figcaption></figure>

                <p><q>'He bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk
                past me without a word. The taper was still on the table, and by its
                light I glanced to see what the paper was which <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> had taken
                from the bureau. To my surprise it was nothing of any importance at
                all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular
                old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It is a sort of ceremony
                peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for centuries past has
                gone through on his coming of age--a thing of private interest, and
                perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own
                blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'We had better come back to the paper afterwards,' said I.</q></p>

                <p><q>'If you think it really necessary,' he answered, with some
                hesitation. 'To continue my statement, however: I relocked the
                bureau, using the key which <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> had left, and I had turned to go
                when I was surprised to find that the butler had returned, and was
                standing before me.</q></p>

                <p><q>'<span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>, sir,' he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with
                emotion, 'I can't bear disgrace, sir. I've always been proud above my
                station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will be on your
                head, sir--it will, indeed--if you drive me to despair. If you cannot
                keep me after what has passed, then for God's sake let me give you
                notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. I could stand
                that, <span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I
                know so well.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'You don't deserve much consideration, <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>,' I answered. 'Your
                conduct has been most infamous. However, as you have been a long time
                in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. A
                month, however is too long. Take yourself away in a week, and give
                what reason you like for going.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'Only a week, sir?' he cried, in a despairing voice. 'A
                fortnight--say at least a fortnight!'</q></p>

                <p><q>'A week,' I repeated, 'and you may consider yourself to have been
                very leniently dealt with.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken man,
                while I put out the light and returned to my room.</q></p>

                <p><q>'For two days after this <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> was most assiduous in his attention
                to his duties. I made no allusion to what had passed, and waited with
                some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. On the third
                morning, however he did not appear, as was his custom, after
                breakfast to receive my instructions for the day. As I left the
                dining-room I happened to meet <span class="character" about="Howells">Rachel Howells</span>, the maid. I have told
                you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was
                looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for
                being at work.</q></p>

                <p><q>'You should be in bed,' I said. 'Come back to your duties when you
                are stronger.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to
                suspect that her brain was affected.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'I am strong enough,<span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>,' said she.</q></p>

                <p><q>'We will see what the doctor says,' I answered. 'You must stop work
                now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>.'</q></p>

                <p><q>'The butler is gone', said she.</q></p>

            <h1>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.</h1>
            <h2>XVIII. - THE ADVENTURE OF THE THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL.</h2>
            <h3>BY A. CONAN DOYLE.</h3>

            <p>An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
            <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> was that, although in his methods of thought he was
            the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
            affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
            his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
            fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
            in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in <span class="places" about="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</span>,
            coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
            me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
            limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
            coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
            his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
            very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
            virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
            be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, in one of his
            queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
            hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
            a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
            the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.<p>

            <p>Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics
            which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning
            up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places. But his
            papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying documents,
            especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it
            was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to
            docket and arrange them; for, as I have mentioned somewhere in these
            incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he
            performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were
            followed by reactions of lethargy during which he would lie about
            with his violin and his books, hardly moving save from the sofa to
            the table. Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every
            corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were
            on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by
            their owner.</p>
            <p>One winter's night, as we sat together by the fire, I
            ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting extracts
            into his common-place book, he might employ the next two hours in
            making our room a little more habitable. He could not deny the
            justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to
            his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box
            behind him. This he placed in the middle of the floor and, squatting
            down upon a stool in front of it, he threw back the lid. I could see
            that it was already a third full of bundles of paper tied up with red
            tape into separate packages.</p>

            <p><q>There are cases enough here, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>,</q> said he, looking at me with
            mischievous eyes. <q>I think that if you knew all that I had in this
            box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting others in.</q></p>

            <p><q>These are the records of your early work, then?</q> I asked. <q>I have
            often wished that I had notes of those cases.</q></p>

            <p><q>Yes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my biographer
            had come to glorify me.</q> He lifted bundle after bundle in a tender,
            caressing sort of way. <q>They are not all successes, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>,</q> said he.
            <q>but there are some pretty little problems among them. Here's the
            record of the <span class="citedCase" about="Tarleton">Tarleton murders</span>, and the <span class="citedCase" about="Vamberry">case of Vamberry</span>, <span class="citedCase" about="wineMerchant">the wine
            merchant</span>, and <span class="citedCase" about="russianWoman">the adventure of the old Russian woman</span>, and <span class="citedCase" about="aluminiumCrutch">the
            singular affair of the aluminium crutch</span>, as well as a full account of
            <span class="citedCase" about="Ricoletti">Ricoletti</span> of the club-foot, and his abominable wife. And here--ah,
            now, this really is something a little recherche.</q></p>

            <p>He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up a
            small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children's toys are kept
            in. From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper, an
            old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string attached
            to it, and three rusty old disks of metal.</p>

            <p><q>Well, my boy, what do you make of this lot?</q> he asked, smiling at my
            expression.</p>

            <p><q>It is a curious collection.</q></p>

            <p><q>Very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as
            being more curious still.</q></p>

            <p><q>These relics have a history then?</q></p>

            <p><q>So much so that they are history.</q></p>

            <p><q>What do you mean by that?</q></p>

            <p><span class="character" about="Sherlock">Sherlock Holmes</span> picked them up one by one, and laid them along the
            edge of the table. Then he reseated himself in his chair and looked
            them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.</p>

            <p><q>These,</q> said he, <q>are all that I have left to remind me of the
            adventure of the Musgrave Ritual.</q></p>

            <p>I had heard him mention the case more than once, though I had never
            been able to gather the details.</p>
            <p><q>I should be so glad,</q> said I, <q>you would give me an account of it.</q></p>

            <p><q>And leave the litter as it is?</q> he cried, mischievously. <q>Your
            tidiness won't bear much strain after all, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>. But I should be
            glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there are
            points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal records of
            this or, I believe, of any other country. A collection of my trifling
            achievements would certainly be incomplete which contained no account
            of this very singular business.</q></p>
            <figure><img src="#Musgrave1" alt="MusgraveRitual1_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>A curious collection</figcaption></figure>

            <p><q>You may remember how <span class="citedCase" about="affairGloria">the affair of the <i>Gloria Scott</i></span>, and my
            conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first
            turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has
            become my life's work. You see me now when my name has become known
            far and wide, and when I am generally recognized both by the public
            and by the official force as being a final court of appeal in
            doubtful cases. Even when you knew me first, at the time of the
            affair which you have commemorated in <cite><span class="works" about="StudyScarlet">A Study in Scarlet,</cite> I had
            already established a considerable, though not a very lucrative,
            connection. You can hardly realize, then, how difficult I found it at
            first, and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any
            headway.</q></p>

            <p><q>When I first came up to <span class="places" about="London">London</span> I had rooms in <span class="places" about="MontagueStreet">Montague Street</span>, just
            round the corner from the <span class="works" about="British">British Museum</span>, and there I waited, filling
            in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of
            science which might make me more efficient. Now and again cases came
            in my way, principally through the introduction of old
            fellow-students, for during my last years at the University there was
            a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods. The third of
            these cases was that of the Musgrave Ritual, and it is to the
            interest which was aroused by that singular chain of events, and the
            large issues which proved to be at stake, that I trace my first
            stride towards the position which I now hold</q></p>

            <p><q><span class="charachter" about="RMusgrave">Reginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I had
            some slight acquaintance with him. He was not generally popular among
            the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me that what was set
            down as pride was really an attempt to cover extreme natural
            diffidence. In appearance he was a man of exceedingly aristocratic
            type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed, with languid and yet courtly
            manners. He was indeed a scion of one of the very oldest families in
            the kingdom, though his branch was a cadet one which had separated
            from the northern Musgraves some time in the sixteenth century, and
            had established itself in western Sussex, where the Manor House of
            Hurlstone is perhaps the oldest inhabited building in the county.
            Something of his birth place seemed to cling to the man, and I never
            looked at his pale, keen face or the poise of his head without
            associating him with gray archways and mullioned windows and all the
            venerable wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into
            talk, and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen
            interest in my methods of observation and inference.</q></p>

            <p><q>For four years I had seen nothing of him until one morning he walked
            into my room in <span class="works" about="MontagueStreet">Montague Street</span>. He had changed little, was dressed
            like a young man of fashion--he was always a bit of a dandy--and
            preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had formerly
            distinguished him.</q></p>

            <p><q>'How has all gone with you <span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Musgrave</span>?' I asked, after we had
            cordially shaken hands.</q></p>

            <p><q>"'You probably heard of my poor father's death,' said he; 'he was
            carried off about two years ago. Since then I have of course had the
            Hurlstone estates to manage, and as I am member for my district as
            well, my life has been a busy one. But I understand, <span class="character" about="Sherlock">Holmes</span>, that you
            are turning to practical ends those powers with which you used to
            amaze us?'</q></p>

            <p><q>'Yes,' said I, 'I have taken to living by my wits.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be
            exceedingly valuable to me. We have had some very strange doings at
            <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>, and the police have been able to throw no light upon the
            matter. It is really the most extraordinary and inexplicable
            business.'</q></p>

            <figure><img src="#Musgrave2" alt="MusgraveRitual2_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>Reginald Musgrave</figcaption></figure>

            <p><q>You can imagine with what eagerness I listened to him, <span class="character" about="Watson">Watson</span>, for
            the very chance for which I had been panting during all those months
            of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. In my inmost heart I
            believed that I could succeed where others failed, and now I had the
            opportunity to test myself.</q></p>

            <p><q>'Pray, let me have the details,' I cried.</q></p>

            <p><q><span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Reginald Musgrave</span> sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette
            which I had pushed towards him.</q></p>

            <p><q>'You must know,' said he, 'that though I am a bachelor, I have to
            keep up a considerable staff of servants at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>, for it is a
            rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after. I
            , too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a
            house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed. Altogether
            there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two footmen, and a boy.
            The garden and the stables of course have a separate staff.</q></p>

            <p><q>'Of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was
            Brunton the butler. He was a young school-master out of place when he
            was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of great energy and
            character, and he soon became quite invaluable in the household. He
            was a well-grown, handsome man, with a splendid forehead, and though
            he has been with us for twenty years he cannot be more than forty
            now. With his personal advantages and his extraordinary gifts--for he
            can speak several languages and play nearly every musical
            instrument--it is wonderful that he should have been satisfied so
            long in such a position, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and
            lacked energy to make any change. The butler of <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span> is always a
            thing that is remembered by all who visit us.</q></p>

            <p><q>'But this paragon has one fault. He is a bit of a Don Juan, and you
            can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very difficult part
            to play in a quiet country district. When he was married it was all
            right, but since he has been a widower we have had no end of trouble
            with him. A few months ago we were in hopes that he was about to
            settle down again for he became engaged to <span class="character" about="Howells">Rachel Howells</span>, our second
            house-maid; but he has thrown her over since then and taken up with
            <span class="character" about="Tragellis">Janet Tregellis</span>, the daughter of the head game-keeper. <span class="charachter" about="Rachel">Rachel</span>--who is
            a very good girl, but of an excitable Welsh temperament--had a sharp
            touch of brain-fever, and goes about the house now--or did until
            yesterday--like a black-eyed shadow of her former self. That was our
            first drama at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span>; but a second one came to drive it from our
            minds, and it was prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler
            Brunton.</q></p>

            <p><q>'This was how it came about. I have said that the man was
            intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for it
            seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things which did
            not in the least concern him. I had no idea of the lengths to which
            this would carry him, until the merest accident opened my eyes to it.</q></p>

            <p><q>'I have said that the house is a rambling one. One day last week--on
            Thursday night, to be more exact--I found that I could not sleep,
            having foolishly taken a cup of strong cafe noir after my dinner.
            After struggling against it until two in the morning, I felt that it
            was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention
            of continuing a novel which I was reading. The book, however, had
            been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on my dressing-gown and
            started off to get it.</q></p>

            <p><q>'In order to reach the billiard-room I had to descend a flight of
            stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to the
            library and the gun-room. You can imagine my surprise when, as I
            looked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light coming from the
            open door of the library. I had myself extinguished the lamp and
            closed the door before coming to bed. Naturally my first thought was
            of burglars. The corridors at <span class="places" about="Hurlstone">Hurlstone</span> have their walls largely
            decorated with trophies of old weapons. From one of these I picked a
            battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on tiptoe
            down the passage and peeped in at the open door.</q></p>

            <p><q>'<span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>, the butler, was in the library. He was sitting, fully
            dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked like a
            map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in
            deep thought. I stood dumb with astonishment, watching him from the
            darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light
            which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. Suddenly, as I
            looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the
            side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From this he
            took a paper, and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside
            the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute
            attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family
            documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward, and <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>,
            looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet,
            his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the
            chart-like paper which he had been originally studying.</q></p>

            <p><q>'So!' said I. 'This is how you repay the trust which we have
            reposed in you. You will leave my service to-morrow.</q></p>

            <figure><img src="#Musgrave3" alt="MusgraveRitual3_StrandMagazine"/><figcaption>He sprang to his feet</figcaption></figure>

            <p><q>'He bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and slunk
            past me without a word. The taper was still on the table, and by its
            light I glanced to see what the paper was which <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> had taken
            from the bureau. To my surprise it was nothing of any importance at
            all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular
            old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It is a sort of ceremony
            peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for centuries past has
            gone through on his coming of age--a thing of private interest, and
            perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own
            blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'We had better come back to the paper afterwards,' said I.</q></p>

            <p><q>'If you think it really necessary,' he answered, with some
            hesitation. 'To continue my statement, however: I relocked the
            bureau, using the key which <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> had left, and I had turned to go
            when I was surprised to find that the butler had returned, and was
            standing before me.</q></p>

            <p><q>'<span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>, sir,' he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with
            emotion, 'I can't bear disgrace, sir. I've always been proud above my
            station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood will be on your
            head, sir--it will, indeed--if you drive me to despair. If you cannot
            keep me after what has passed, then for God's sake let me give you
            notice and leave in a month, as if of my own free will. I could stand
            that, <span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>, but not to be cast out before all the folk that I
            know so well.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'You don't deserve much consideration, <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>,' I answered. 'Your
            conduct has been most infamous. However, as you have been a long time
            in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace upon you. A
            month, however is too long. Take yourself away in a week, and give
            what reason you like for going.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'Only a week, sir?' he cried, in a despairing voice. 'A
            fortnight--say at least a fortnight!'</q></p>

            <p><q>'A week,' I repeated, 'and you may consider yourself to have been
            very leniently dealt with.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken man,
            while I put out the light and returned to my room.</q></p>

            <p><q>'For two days after this <span class="character" about="Brunton">Brunton</span> was most assiduous in his attention
            to his duties. I made no allusion to what had passed, and waited with
            some curiosity to see how he would cover his disgrace. On the third
            morning, however he did not appear, as was his custom, after
            breakfast to receive my instructions for the day. As I left the
            dining-room I happened to meet <span class="character" about="Howells">Rachel Howells</span>, the maid. I have told
            you that she had only recently recovered from an illness, and was
            looking so wretchedly pale and wan that I remonstrated with her for
            being at work.</q></p>

            <p><q>'You should be in bed,' I said. 'Come back to your duties when you
            are stronger.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to
            suspect that her brain was affected.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'I am strong enough,<span class="character" about="RMusgrave">Mr. Musgrave</span>,' said she.</q></p>

            <p><q>'We will see what the doctor says,' I answered. 'You must stop work
            now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see <span class="charachter" about="Brunton">Brunton</span>.'</q></p>

            <p><q>'The butler is gone', said she.</q></p>

            <p><q>'Gone! Gone where?'</q></p>
