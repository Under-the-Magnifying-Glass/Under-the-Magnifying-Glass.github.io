            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>

            <p>Under the Magnifying Glass is a digital magazine on famous literary detective figures. Each issue contains selected stories and
            articles that contain metadata-enriched text and a stylistically customizable layout according to six historically inspired themes. </p>
            <p>
          </div>

          <div class="row" id="manuscript_style">
            <h2>Manuscript Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>

            <p>The first style the user can choose to navigate the page in, was set to be inspired by the style of XVI century manuscripts, especially German and Dutch ones (e.g. Thantwerpen, Gheprint by H. Peeterssen, van Middelburch, ca 1540).
The screen background changes to a yellowish, manuscript-paper like color, and the font becomes more and more voluptuous, the colors shifts to a brown-ochre palette that influences mainly hyperlinks, inline and in the navbars, and borders, of tables and buttons.</p> <p>The images are filtered with a sepia effect and an image-border on the left and right was used to recall the minaited grid around images in the manuscripts. Headings were also coloured in red and bordered to follow the style of the grid system in the written version, paragraphs’ texts is justified and right and bottom margin are increased to emphasized the manuscripts’ look. The first letter of each paragraph was encapsulated in a bordered box to recall miniated capoletters, while tables and buttons despite having no lookalike in the printed versions have been simply solid bordered with a black line to emulate what happens with images in the printed versions.

          <div class="row" id="print_style">
            <h2>Early Print Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>

            <p>The second reading style found its first source of inspiration in the XIXth century first newspapers, the screen background is set to recall the white-greyish paper of the printed journals, with their folds and spots of spilled ink (The Times, … ); The paragraphs are also styled to look like articles in a newspaper, with a font chosen to be the most similar as possible to the ones used in the printing, and the division of the text in two columns. For what concerns the navbars (both the fixed one and the second for the toggling of the articles to display in the issue page) a double border was given following the style of the dateline under the masthead of newspapers.</p>
<p>To this main inspiration was however added a second one: since Sherlock Holmes’ stories were first published in the late XIX century on a magazine called The Strand Magazine, its style was taken in consideration for all the details in the webpage. Starting from the font of the titles, different to the ones used for the paragraphs and more similar to the one of the headings in The Strand, with its slightly elongated and curled serifs. The style (border and background) of the tables (both in texts and the metadata one) and buttons was also inspired by the magazine, and specifically by the box on the front page with the info on the publication, while the background color of the cover was used for active and hover links and hover boxes in the main page. Lastly all images were filtered to be black and white and blurred on the borders, and their captions were rendered in all caps as it’s the case in the stories published in The Strand.

            <h2>Bauhaus Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>


            <p>The layout follows the golden section rules introduced by Tsichold in the 19th century, proposing a
              page proportion of 2:3 which can be achieved by margin proportions of 1:1:2:3 (from left to bottom).
              Diagonal axis


            <p> Regarding the text, we used variations of three sans-serif fonts, resembling the historic Bayer's <i>Universal</i>, or of fonts displayed in publications of the time which were our source of inspiration.
            Paragraphs are set to the default size of 1em, while headings and other text components feature variety in size, weight, and transformations of full lowercase or uppercase,
          to achieve the visuals that were prominent in publications of the time. </p>


            <p>For what concerns colors, traditional bauhaus publications were often in primarily black and white. We use
              the same approach for our main and article page, maintaining an off-white shade as a background, and black color for text paragraphs and headings, navbar menu and boxes, and a grayscale filter on all images throughout the website.
              Of course, the <b>primary colors</b> could not be missing from this theme, so we incorporated them in the details of secondary elements such as borders, buttons, active and bold elements and headers for
              emphasis purposes. Lastly, we added thick lines for underlining/emphasis, an element often present in bauhaus publications and posters.</p>

            <p>Inspiration for the design of this style was drafted from <a href="https://www.bauhaus-bookshelf.org/bauhaus-original-sources-for-pdf-download.html"> bauhaus-bookshelf</a>,
              a virtual archive of bauhaus books and journals. We also referred to the freely available <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/65208"> color palette </a>for the precise values of the style's colors.</p>

          <div class="row" id="sixties_style">
            <h2>Sixties Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>

            <p>This style is inspired by the psychedelic posters produced by artists like Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson and to their use of vibrating colours and impactful fonts.
            Together with the psychedelic posters, the magazines produced in this period  have been taken into account for developing the issues' layout.
            The use of the 'Cooper Black' font in titles and texts, often accompanied by colors and background colors for the headings has been inspired by the magazine pictures available<a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org/?dims=Decade,Format&vals0=1960s&friendly0=1960s&vals1=Periodical&friendly1=Periodical"> here</a>, an example of which is this one:

            <p>Two fonts have been used for this style:
              <ul>
              <li><b>Moscoso </b> <p>- this font is based on the 1960s psychedelic poster lettering of the artist Victor Moscoso. The letterforms are derived from some of his most celebrated Neon Rose posters of the late sixties, in particular the archetypical Moby Grape Neptune’s Notion of 1967.<p><a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/30412/victor-moscoso">Click to see the font in use</a></li>


               <li><b> Cooper Black </b><p>- Cooper Black is an ultra-bold serif typeface intended for display use that was designed by Oswald Bruce Cooper and released by the Barnhart Brothers & Spindler type foundry in 1922. Its use in pop culture increased worldwide since 1966, when the Beach Boys used it for the cover artwork of their album Pet Sounds. It was then featured in the Doors’ L.A. Woman (1971) and in other famous album covers and shlows. As a result, Cooper Black has become emblematic of late-1960s/early-1970s style. </p> <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7357/cooper-black">Click to see the font in use</a></li>
             </ul></p>

             <p>The color palette is inspired by the Neon Rose posters of Moscoso. It was a series of posters characterized by the predominance of magenta tones presented in contrast with blue and yellowish ones. Examples of these posters are available  <a href="https://www.classicposters.com/product-category/neon-rose/nr-0-nr-26/">here.</a> </p>

            <p>Images and tables are presented in form of posters, imitating Moscoso, Wilson and their cotemporary artist’s style through the use of colors and the font. A background color has been assigned to the element figure in order to create a “poster effect”. A combination of filters has allowed to convey a bright blue tonality to the images.</p>

            <h2>Vaporwave Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>


<!-- intro -->
            <p>Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, visual art style, and Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.</p>
            <p>This genre embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium, incorporating early
               Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes, as well as anime,
               Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects, resulting in a nostalgic, futuristic and often bizarre character. </p>

<!-- choices -->
            <p> To represent this aesthetic on our website, we implemented the use of primarily cyan, pink and purple shades, emphasized outline borders and shadows, pixel gifs and theme-related images.</p>
            <p> Lastly, music could not be absent from this style as it was the origin of the vaporwave movement,
              with the use of the track "Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing" of the <i>Floral Shoppe</i> album by the artist <i>Macintosh Plus</i>, one of the most
              popular albums of the vaporwave subgenre. This track, much like the whole vaporwave movement, has a warm, nostalgic and futuristic character, while still remaining simple. </p>
            <p> Since the visual aesthetics of vaporwave were primarily created in the web, our source of inspiration was primarily that of
              <a href= "https://neocities.org/browse?tag=vaporwave">a series of websites </a>following that specific style.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row" id="future_style">
            <h2>Future Style</h2>
            <div class='bauhaus-line'></div>

            <p>The future style is inspired by sci-fi and cyberpunk dystopic artworks.
In particular, the movie “Matrix” has inspired the color palette and the background image of the homepage: the green text displayed on a dark background is a tribute to the Matrix “digital rain” representing on computer screens the activity of the simulated reality environment of the Matrix on screen by kinetic typography. But not only: it recalls the code written on the dark background of a command prompt. </p>

<p>Textual and image elements are displayed in a screen-like modality, produced thanks to the backdrop filter effect and the box shadows that allows to enlighten it. </p>


<p>Animations play an important role in the layout, allowing to apply visual effects to the displayed text as it could happen in a videogame set in this dystopic future. A Glitch-like animation has been used to render the intermittent functioning of the screens. An animation has also been used to show the text of the titles of the issues falling down from above recalling the digital rain of the Matrix film, but also imitating the landing to the ground of a spaceship.</p>

<p>A square, sci-fi techno headline typeface, Xirod, has been chosen for creating the futuristic sci-fi atmosphere. </p>

<p>Images and tables are displayed as screens and have been assigned the typical aspect-ratio of screens, 4:3, also known as 1.33:1 or fullscreen. An animation reproduces on them the same glitched effect applyed to the headins of the issues.  A combination of css filters has been applied to the images for making their color fit with the green of the textual elements and the atmosphere described before.</p>
