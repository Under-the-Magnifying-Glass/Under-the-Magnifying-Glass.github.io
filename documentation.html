            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Under the Magnifying Glass is a digital magazine on famous literary detective figures. Each issue contains selected stories and
            articles that contain metadata-enriched text and a stylistically customizable layout according to six historically inspired themes. </p>

          <div class="row" id="manuscript_style">
            <h2>Manuscript Style</h2>
            <p>The first style the user can choose to navigate the page in, was set to be inspired by the style of XVI century manuscripts, especially German and Dutch ones (e.g. Thantwerpen, Gheprint by H. Peeterssen, van Middelburch, ca 1540).
The screen background changes to a yellowish, manuscript-paper like color, and the font becomes more and more voluptuous, the colors shifts to a brown-ochre palette that influences mainly hyperlinks, inline and in the navbars, and borders, of tables and buttons.</p> <p>The images are filtered with a sepia effect and an image-border on the left and right was used to recall the minaited grid around images in the manuscripts. Headings were also coloured in red and bordered to follow the style of the grid system in the written version, paragraphs’ texts is justified and right and bottom margin are increased to emphasized the manuscripts’ look. The first letter of each paragraph was encapsulated in a bordered box to recall miniated capoletters, while tables and buttons despite having no lookalike in the printed versions have been simply solid bordered with a black line to emulate what happens with images in the printed versions.

          <div class="row" id="print_style">
            <h2>Early Print Style</h2>
            <p>The second reading style found its first source of inspiration in the XIXth century first newspapers, the screen background is set to recall the white-greyish paper of the printed journals, with their folds and spots of spilled ink (The Times, … ); The paragraphs are also styled to look like articles in a newspaper, with a font chosen to be the most similar as possible to the ones used in the printing, and the division of the text in two columns. For what concerns the navbars (both the fixed one and the second for the toggling of the articles to display in the issue page) a double border was given following the style of the dateline under the masthead of newspapers.</p>
<p>To this main inspiration was however added a second one: since Sherlock Holmes’ stories were first published in the late XIX century on a magazine called The Strand Magazine, its style was taken in consideration for all the details in the webpage. Starting from the font of the titles, different to the ones used for the paragraphs and more similar to the one of the headings in The Strand, with its slightly elongated and curled serifs. The style (border and background) of the tables (both in texts and the metadata one) and buttons was also inspired by the magazine, and specifically by the box on the front page with the info on the publication, while the background color of the cover was used for active and hover links and hover boxes in the main page. Lastly all images were filtered to be black and white and blurred on the borders, and their captions were rendered in all caps as it’s the case in the stories published in The Strand.

            <h2>Bauhaus Style</h2>

            <p>The layout follows the golden section rules introduced by Tsichold in the 19th century, proposing a
              page proportion of 2:3 which can be achieved by margin proportions of 1:1:2:3 (from left to bottom). </p>
              "Page proportion 2:3. Margin proportions 1:1:2:3.
            Diagonal axis </p>

            <p>The main and articles page are mostly black and white, with colors present primarily in the details of secondary elements such as borders, buttons, active and bold elements and headers for
              emphasis purposes. Thick lines for underlining.</p>

            <p> Font links and explanation. Inspiration for the design of this style was drafted from <a href="https://www.bauhaus-bookshelf.org/bauhaus-original-sources-for-pdf-download.html"> bauhaus-bookshelf</a>,
              a virtual archive of bauhaus books and journals. We also referred to the freely available <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/65208"> color palette </a>for the precise values of the style's colors.</p>

<h6>Moscoso </h6>
<p>Based on the 1960s psychedelic poster lettering of the artist Victor Moscoso. The letterforms are derived from some of his most celebrated Neon Rose posters of the late sixties, in particular the archetypical Moby Grape Neptune’s Notion of 1967.</p>

<h6> Cooper Black </h6>
          <p>
Cooper Black is an ultra-bold serif typeface intended for display use that was designed by Oswald Bruce Cooper and released by the Barnhart Brothers & Spindler type foundry in 1922. Its use in pop culture increased worldwide since 1966, when the Beach Boys used it for the cover artwork of their album Pet Sounds. It was then featured in the Doors’ L.A. Woman (1971) and in other famous album covers and shlows. As a result, Cooper Black has become emblematic of late-1960s/early-1970s style. </p>

            <h2>Vaporwave Style</h2>

<!-- intro -->
            <p>Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music, visual art style, and Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.</p>
            <p>This genre embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic medium, incorporating early
               Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes, as well as anime,
               Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects, resulting in a nostalgic, futuristic and often bizarre character. </p>

<!-- choices -->
            <p> To represent this aesthetic on our website, we implemented the use of primarily cyan, pink and purple shades, emphasized outline borders and shadows, pixel gifs and theme-related images.</p>
            <p> Lastly, music could not be absent from this style as it was the origin of the vaporwave movement,
              with the use of the track "Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing" of the <i>Floral Shoppe</i> album by the artist <i>Macintosh Plus</i>, one of the most
              popular albums of the vaporwave subgenre. This track, much like the whole vaporwave movement, has a warm, nostalgic and futuristic character, while still remaining simple. </p>
            <p> Since the visual aesthetics of vaporwave were primarily created in the web, our source of inspiration was primarily that of
              <a href= "https://neocities.org/browse?tag=vaporwave">a series of websites </a>following that specific style.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row" id="future_style">
            <h2>Future Style</h2>
            <h5> LAYOUT</h5>
<p>This layout style displays textual and image elements in a screen-like modality, produced thanks to the backdrop filter effect and the box shadows that allow to enlighten it.</p>
            <h5>FONT</h5>
<p>Xirod ( https://www.dafont.com/xirod.font   https://www.fonts4free.net/xirod-font.html )
Xirod is a square, sci-fi techno headline typeface. It has been chosen for creating a futuristic sci-fi atmosphere. </p>

            <h5>USE OF COLORS</h5>
<p>The movie “Matrix” has inspired the color palette and the background image of the homepage: the green text displayed on a dark background is a tribute to the Matrix “digital rain” representing on computer screens the activity of the simulated reality environment of the Matrix on screen by kinetic typography. But not only: it recalls the code written on the dark background of a command prompt. </p>
            <h5>USE OF ANIMATIONS</h5>
<p>A Glitch-like animation has been used to render the screens displaying in this dystopic future.</p>
<p>An animation has also been used to show the text of the titles of the issues falling down from above recalling the digital rain of the Matrix film, but also imitating the landing to the ground of a spaceship.</p>

            <h5>IMAGES AND TABLES</h5>
<p>Images and tables are displayed as screens.  A combination of css filters has been applied to the images for making their color fit with the green of the textual elements and the atmosphere described before.</p>
